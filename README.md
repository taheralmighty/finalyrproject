People with color vision deficiencies experience many limitations in various areas
of daily life. Example, reading figures in publications, identifying traffic signal
colors, etc. However such a deficiency does not imply the inability to perceive
any color.

ToÂ help the color impaired individuals(deuteranopic), a system is to be designed that
automatically re-colorizes the image replacing the colors which are not visible to the
color impaired individuals(deuteranopic) with the closest color.
